EmojiData.lua maps complete Unicode sequences to atlas slots. Emoji.lua
groups ZWJ sequences, modifiers, keycaps, regional flags, tag flags and
presentation selectors before looking them up. Unsupported future emoji
are displayed as one readable [emoji U+...] fallback. Original stored
messages stay unchanged. Assets ship with the addon and desktop package.
